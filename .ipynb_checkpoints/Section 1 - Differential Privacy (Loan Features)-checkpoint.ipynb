Each row corresponds to a person. Each value corresponds to whether or not that person has a certain private attribute (such as whether they have a certain disease, or whether they are above/below a certain age). We are then going to learn how to know whether a database query over such a small database is differentially private or not - and more importantly - what techniques are at our disposal to ensure various levels of privacy\n",

    "As you can see, the basic sum query is not differentially private at all! In truth, differential privacy always requires a form of randomness added to the query. Let me show you what I mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomised Response (Local Differential Privacy)\n",
    "> **Local Differential Privacy**: Adds noise to function data points (function inputs/each individual data point)\n",
    "> **Randomised Response**: Technique that is used in social sciences when trying to learn about the high level trends for a taboo behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say I have a group of people I wish to survey about a very taboo behavior which I think they will lie about (say, I want to know if they have ever committed a certain kind of crime). I'm not a policeman, I'm just trying to collect statistics to understand the higher level trend in society. So, how do we do this? One technique is to add randomness to each person's response by giving each person the following instructions (assuming I'm asking a simple yes/no question):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flip a coin 2 times.\n",
    "- If the first coin flip is heads, answer honestly\n",
    "- If the first coin flip is tails, answer according to the second coin flip (heads for yes, tails for no)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, each person is now protected with **\"plausible deniability\"**. If they answer \"Yes\" to the question \"have you committed X crime?\", then it might becasue they actually did, or it might be because they are answering according to a random coin flip. Each person has a high degree of protection. Furthermore, we can recover the underlying statistics with some accuracy, as the \"true statistics\" are simply averaged with a 50% probability. Thus, if we collect a bunch of samples and it turns out that 60% of people answer yes, then we know that the TRUE distribution is actually centered around 70%, because 70% averaged wtih 50% (a coin flip) is 60% which is the result we obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that, especially when we only have a few samples, this comes at the cost of accuracy. This tradeoff exists across all of Differential Privacy. The greater the privacy protection (plausible deniability) the less accurate the results. \n",
